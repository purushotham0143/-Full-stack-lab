// The concepts of one-tier, two-tier, three-tier, and four-tier architectures refer to the way applications are structured in terms of their components and how these components interact. Here’s a breakdown of each architecture type:

// 1. One-Tier Architecture
// Description: All components of the application (user interface, business logic, and data access) are hosted on a single system.
// Example: A desktop application where the database, application logic, and user interface run on the same machine.
// Advantages: Simple to develop and deploy; no network latency since everything is local.
// Disadvantages: Limited scalability and flexibility; difficult to maintain and upgrade.




// 2. Two-Tier Architecture
// Description: The application is divided into two layers: the client (presentation layer) and the server (data layer). The client interacts directly with the server.
// Example: A client-server application where the client makes requests to a server hosting a database.
// Advantages: Improved performance since some processing is offloaded to the server; easier to manage than one-tier.
// Disadvantages: Scalability issues as the server can become a bottleneck; tighter coupling between client and server.



// 3. Three-Tier Architecture
// Description: This architecture separates the application into three layers: presentation, application logic (business logic), and data storage. The client communicates with the application server, which then communicates with the database server.
// Example: A web application where the user interface runs in the browser, the business logic is handled by a web server, and the data is stored in a database server.
// Advantages: Improved scalability, flexibility, and maintainability; easier to manage and update different layers independently.
// Disadvantages: More complex architecture; can introduce latency due to multiple communication layers.


// 4. Four-Tier Architecture
// Description: An extension of three-tier architecture that adds an additional layer, typically for services or integration, such as a service layer that can handle API calls or communication with external systems.
// Example: A web application with a user interface, an application server, a service layer, and a database server.
// Advantages: Highly modular; allows for better separation of concerns and integration with other services; enhances scalability and maintainability.
// Disadvantages: Increased complexity; requires more resources for deployment and management.




// Summary
// One-Tier: All in one place (e.g., desktop apps).
// Two-Tier: Client-server model (e.g., database apps).
// Three-Tier: Presentation, application logic, data storage (e.g., web apps).
// Four-Tier: Adds a service layer for external integrations.
// These architectures help developers choose the right approach based on the application’s requirements, performance needs, and scalability concerns.
